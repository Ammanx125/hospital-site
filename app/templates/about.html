    <h1>About Our Hospital</h1>
    <h2>Our story</h2>
    <p>It all started in 2006 when Hallelujah Center for internal Medicine and Chest 
        disease PLC was established and become formally operational in 2007 on Bole Road in 
        front of Bole Printing Press. It has changed its name to Hallelujah Higher Medical 
        Clinic PLC in 2010. Since then, the clinic has been providing medical and consultation 
        services in General Medicine and Pulmonary Medicine in particular. Until 2013, Professor 
        Getachew Aderaye was the only qualified pulmonologist in the country. Hallelujah Higher Medical 
        Clinic was the only private center to provide such a service in specialized field. Due to the increase in 
        demand of medical services, the company planned and constructed a G+6 Building (which is an eight-story building 
        including the basement and ground floors) equipped with latest medical equipmentâ€™s, at the center of Addis.</p>
